# Some Context
This game was made solely as a joke and part of a Christmas gift for my girlfriend who is a huge Harry Potter fan.  That being said, I did not spend any time testing this on browsers other than Chrome / Safari, and I'm 99% sure it will not run on mobile.  I've also cut a lot of corners in a lot of the implementation details because I only had some hours across ~10 days to work on this before Christmas ðŸ˜….

This game is using the engine built by [@coldi](https://github.com/coldi).  I would not have been able to complete this in the short amount of time that I did had it not been for their work, so a huge thanks goes out to them.

Feel free to expand on this and do whatever you'd like with it if you want.  I will not be maintaining this in anyway, but if you have any questions, shoot me an email at **jvasquez864@gmail.com**
